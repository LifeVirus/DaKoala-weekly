Working on existing open source projects.

# License of The Project
The project I choose is [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and its license is [MIT](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/LICENSE). MIT License allows the usage within commercial software and private software. It is very permissive. Users can not only modify the software but also distribute the software.

# Installation of Development Environment

I referred to the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) of Vue.js. I first cloned the repository and tried installing dependencies using `npm`.

In the developing document, packages can be installed either using `npm` or `yarn` and since I do not have `yarn` installed on my computer, I used `npm`.

Everything worked well when I installed dependencies and the distribution file was built successfully when I run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
npm run build
```

However, when I tried running the test scripts using the command:

```bash
npm run test
```

There was an error telling me versions of some dependencies were unmatched. All test cases were supposed to be passed because I did not modify any file at this point.

I returned to the GitHub Repository and found that there was only a `yarn.lock` file but not `package-lock.json` file.

I then installed `yarn`, removed `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`(it was generated after I installed dependencies) files and run:

```bash
yarn
yarn run test
```

All test cases were passed.

Maybe there are different ways to fix this problem, however, as a starting contributors who gets used using `npm`, I am confused by the instruction.

I have already sent an [issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9606) about my experience. If is really is a problem, I will create a pull request to the document.
