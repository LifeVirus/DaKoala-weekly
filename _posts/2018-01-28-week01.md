Open Source:
Before taking this class my first thought when hearing the term "open source" is of programmers working collaboratively on a project that anyone can edit. Also, Firefox.
Open source projects are advantageous in that anyone can submit improvements to them and that they're often freely available. Closed source projects are advantageous in that there's typically a large company backing it. These comapanies keep their code secret, in part, for security reasons. 

Projects:
I use an email app called Postbox based off of the Thunderbird email client. I use it since it handles multiple email accounts in an easy-to-use way. I'm not sure if the latest release would still be considered open source, however. There's a variety of open and closed source email app alternatives.
Last semester in CSO we used a version of Ubuntu to develop and test our C code. As much as I understand it, the reason was two-fold: so that we wouldn't damage our own machines and so the professor could standarize the amount of memory available for our virtual machine. There's a ton of other OS alternatives to Ubuntu!
A few semesters ago my discrete mathematics professor had us write proofs with LaTeX, based off of the open source text formatting system TeX. Any text editor or word processor can serve as an alternative to LaTex, but other than programs like MathType not many handle equations as well. 
Python! Python is open source and I've used it in many classes. There's almost too many open and closed source alternative programming languages to count!

Questions for Tom:
Could you tell us about some of RedHat's enterprise customers?
How does RedHat guarantee their OS meets clients' uptime requirements?
