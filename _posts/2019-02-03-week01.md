# Open Source

## The Term "Open Source"

Several years ago before I became a computer science student, the term "open source", as for me, equalled "free of charge". However, after developing as a programmer for years, I now understand the term differently.

The term "open source" does not only mean that the source code can be viewed by everybody, but also that everybody can contribute to the project. Open source software is supported by the whole community.

## Open Source vs. Closed Source

Open source projects are built for the welfare of mass developers and are supported by developers around the Internet to stay vigorous and robust.

Everyone on the Internet can have access to open source software. In this sense, starters in specific fields do not have financial cost at the beginning. For example if a developer wants to learn front-end development, he/she would probably choose to learn an open source framework because it is easy to set up and do not cost money. This feature helps open source software gain popularity among developers. As these beginners become old hands, they will to contribute to these open source software. An eco-system is built in this way.

Since everyone has access to the code, those who find bugs in the software can immediately fix it. The maintenance of open source software is conducted by the whole community instead of some specific people. In this way, open source software is developed and maintained efficiently.

## Potential Problems

An open source software may be used widely. Once there exists a problem, those who use the software all become vulnerable. Since the source code is open, it is easy for malicious people to find vulnerabilities in the software and attack other users.

Most open source software are developed and maintained voluntarily. A potential problem is that if no one is willing to maintain the project, the project may die. Those rely on the software may turn to alternatives because it takes less cost compared to maintain the software by themselves. Finally the software fades.
