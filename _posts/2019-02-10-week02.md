# New things I learned about `git` and `GitHub`

I learned the difference between different remote repositories. I have seen branch named `upstream` before but did not understand its usage. After this week's class, I learned that it is necessary to have a `origin` remote repo and a `upstream` remote repo if I want to track the update of some open source projects and at the same time make my own changes to it.

When it comes to `git`, I learned how to create new branches and merge different branches. The more important thing in merging branches is handling merge conflicts.
