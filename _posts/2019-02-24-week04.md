Open source project evaluation

# About The Project I Evaluate

The project I would like to evaluate this week is [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Vue.js is a web front-end framework. It applies the idea of "Virtual DOM Tree" and avoids directly manipulating DOMs. This not only saves developers' work but also ensure a good performance of the web page. It also embraces the idea "Component" in front-end development. Generally Vue.js is a quite powerful front-end framework and compared to frameworks responsible for similar work(like `React` and `Angular`), Vue has a smoother learning curve. 

It is one of my favorite open source project. As a front-end developer, I have developed several websites using Vue.js, including my personal website. However, in the past, I was more as a user of Vue.js than a developer of Vue.js. I have read the user document of Vue.js twice but rarely visited the GitHub repository of Vue.js. I choose Vue.js as the open source project to evaluate this week because I am enthusiastic to learn about Vue.js from the perspective of a open source software developer.
